--------------------------------------------------
Software installation steps
--------------------------------------------------


* Delete the old version PKUCAENDAQ folder from the personal directory
* Extract this package to your personal directory ($HOME)
* Compile and install drivers in the *driver* folder

.. code-block:: bash

  cd driver
  tar -zxvf CAENDGTZ-USB-Drv-1.2.tgz
  cd CAENDGTZ-USB-Drv-1.2/
  sudo ./install.sh

  cd ..
  tar -zxvf caen_felib-v1.3.1.tar.gz 
  cd caen_felib-v1.3.1/
  ./configure --disable-assert
  make
  sudo make install
  sudo ldconfig

  cd ..
  tar -zxvf caen_dig2-v1.6.1.tar.gz   
  cd caen_dig2-v1.6.1/
  ./configure --disable-assert
  make
  sudo make install
  sudo ldconfig


* Compile GUI software

.. code-block:: bash
  
  cd GUI
  chmod +x makefile.sh.x
  ./makefile.sh.x
  # Waitting for the compilation to complete. After the compilation is passed, the executable file gddaq will be generated in the folder
  # Check if the executable file gddaq has been generated, and if so, compile successfully. If not, please contact Hongyi Wu.


--------------------------------------------------
Registration of each module in LINUX OS
--------------------------------------------------

Due to the inability of some Linux distributions to automatically retrieve the USB name of the digitizer, registration is required when using this module for the first time. Module registration needs to be done module by module. During the registration process, only one module can be connected to the LINUX OS via USB.

Connect the Type-C end of the USB3.0 cable to the module and the other end to the computer. Then enter CAENDGTZ-USB-{PIDNUMBER} in the browser, where {PIDNUMBER} is replaced with the PID code of the module being used, for example: CAENDGTZ-USB-25480. Check if it can be accessed. If it cannot be accessed, it means that the module has not been registered as a driver yet.

In the USB driver installation package, such as **CAENDGTZ-USB-Drv-1.2**, there is a driver registration script file *regPID.sh*, which can be run using the following command. After execution, you will see a prompt indicating successful registration.


.. code-block:: bash

  sudo ./regPID.sh


Afterwards, by accessing CAENDGTZ-USB-{PIDNUMBER} through the webpage, you can see the following login page, with the default username and password being *admin*.

After logging in, the interface is shown below. In the left menu bar, network settings can be made. If you want to obtain data through Ethernet cable, you can set the IP through this page. According to the laboratory network situation, choose DHCP to automatically allocate IP or manually configure IP. After setting the IP, entering the module's IP in the browser can also access the settings page.

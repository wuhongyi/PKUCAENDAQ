Open FPGA
##################################################

CAEN open FPGA includes two development modes, one is the graphical software SCI-Compiler, which is suitable for people without FPGA programming foundation to develop firmware; The other is a non-public Open-FDK, suitable for professional FPGA developers. The firmware developed in these two modes can be distinguished by the information of the firmware. The firmware we released is developed for Open-FDK.

The firmware developed by SCI-Compiler requires the running acquisition module to have a SCI-Compiler Runtime license, otherwise it can only run for 30 minutes. The 30 minute testing time can be regained by restarting.

The firmware developed by Open-FDK does not have any license requirements for the acquisition modules.
